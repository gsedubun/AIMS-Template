Agent mode with Claude Opus 4.5

1. fix error "There is already an object named 'AspNetRoles' in the database." when running dotnet ef database update

2. add system wide audittrail  feature in this app
3. add Role based access with User management page to administer User and assign roles to each user.
4. system has 3 roles Admin, Manager and User. Admin has full access to all features, Manager has access to manage users and view audit trails, User has access to view their own data and audit trails.
	•	Default Admin User:
	Username: admin
	Email: admin@aims.local
	Password: Admin@123
5. add a feature to log  all user activities in the system, such as login, logout, data changes to audit trail. This will help in monitoring and auditing user actions for security and compliance purposes.
// Inject IActivityLogger
private readonly IActivityLogger _activityLogger;

// Log a security activity
await _activityLogger.LogSecurityActivityAsync(
    ActivityType.Login,
    "User logged in successfully",
    "Success",
    userId,
    userName);

// Log a general activity
await _activityLogger.LogActivityAsync(
    ActivityType.UserCreated,
    "Created new user 'john.doe'",
    "ApplicationUser",
    userId,
    "Success");

6. create a CRUD page for AssetItem entity. only Admin and Manager can create, update and delete AssetItems, while User can only view the list of AssetItems. The page should display a list of AssetItems with options to create, edit, and delete based on the user's role. 
    
7. implement a search and filter functionality on the AssetItem list page to allow users to easily find specific items based on criteria such as AssetId, Description, or Type. 
  Also add a menu to navigate to the AssetItem management page in the application.
8. add details page for AssetItem throught link from Index page for AssetId. In this details page, allow users to add AssetItemRemarks for the opened AssetItem.
9. include CreateBy column in AssetItemRemarks that is filled with name of the user that input the remarks
